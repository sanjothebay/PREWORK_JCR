        <p>Sean Daley and Derek Turner met while attending Washburn High School.
            The two took the names Slug and D-Spawn, respectively, as rapper names. 
            They initially performed under the name "Mental Subjects", 
            before changing the name to "A Rhythmic Culture", and finally settling on "Urban Atmosphere". 
            Originally, Spawn performed as the rapper, with Slug acting as DJ. 
            Eventually Spawn convinced Slug to start rapping as well. 
            Through the rapper Musab (then known as Beyond), 
            Slug was introduced to the producer Ant after they went to his house to record a track. 
            Slug saw an opportunity to work with Ant and convinced Spawn to record further with him.
